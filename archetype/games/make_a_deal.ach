# On a game show similar to Letâ€™s Make a Deal, a contestant is shown
# three closed doors and told that behind one of them is a Corvette,
# and behind the other two are goats.  They are asked to choose a
# door.  The door remains closed for the moment.  Next, the game show
# host, according to the rules, has to open one of the remaining two
# doors, which he does, revealing a goat.  (He's never going to reveal
# the car.) The host now gives the contestant a chance to change their
# choice before finally opening the door and winning whatever is
# behind it.
#
# What are the results of each strategy?
